Those voices slowly become intrusive thoughts that you can (semi-)peacefully shut down.  I wish every survivor robust community &amp; healthy remodelling 💞 . That in retrospect is such a concrete example to me of white women weaponising their tears against BIPOC. White women will literally shed tears to gain the upper hand, gaslight you, sic other white women on you &amp; weaponise white men against you to come to their damsel defense . P.S. here I'm not talking about the rare cases when people who are obviously part of hegemonic power in every way possible apply for asylum bc they "don't like it" (e.g. white cis USians sometimes do this bc they didn't like the election outcomes??) &amp; others point this out . It's horrifying (but informative) reading about colonialism in the subcontinent--centuries of brutal Dutch+Portuguese+British colonisation devastated the region &amp; unsettled folks, but now formerly-colonised majority groups are acting as settlers against minority Indigenous folks .

It's crucial to be specific about layers of racism as they impact diff groups &amp; not always conflate experiences, but "BIPOC" isn't necessarily a bad term by itself, e.g. the umbrella term can be useful for racialised non-USians w/ complicated relationships to US race categories . #USER# Holy shit, I'm so glad to hear you're okay. Do you need anything right now? . Refugee here (and not the UN quota kind--the fled-as-an-asylum-seeker kind).

Nah I'm done romanticising this.

I'd be far less surprised by the ridiculous whining had I not directly experienced harm from yt trans folks countless times .

"trauma dumping" this, "trauma dumping" that, how about we talk about my trauma dump truck ass . Underdeveloped theorisation of gender isn't a downside of self-identification either (esp. when self-ID is an absolutely crucial first step to liberating ourselves from colonial gender categorisations), neither is bad theory exclusively the domain of 'fresher' trans folks. .

With a lil button like on coffee machines to adjust sugar &amp; strength but for pH and temperature of the buffers pls 😌 . I've talked about this before, but "validity is immaterial" is itself a position of privilege, &amp; I need y'all to think about this more.

If you're really gonna skimp on masks, one way to retain efficacy is to (again, this isn't ideal) reuse a rotation of 3-4 disposable masks.

"I have ADHD :(" so do I &amp; I'm dealing with a bunch of systemic bullshit as well...and you might not want to admit this to yourself, but your mind is telling you something about the relationships you feel less inclined to tend to when times get tough when you don't tend to them . #USER# Oh absolutely (especially given that NL was one of the OG colonisers who paved the path for further British colonisation of the east + they were primary facilitators of the slave trade). My point is they aren't progressive even by their pathetic white standards. It's ridiculous . Oof, qrts are missing the point that many folks (esp poor white USians) position themselves as anti-capitalist not from a liberationist mindset, but rather out of self-centered annoyance at being poor.

It's interesting to witness the convenient moments (read: when it doesn't directly serve them or disrupts their white voice) when white folks will choose to "take a step back" for "self care" bc they are "setting boundaries".

Shut the FUCK up w/ these "jokes", yt ppl. #URL# . #USER# This is my issue with most isolated models studying phenomenon of this sort. It's fine to do modelling &amp; be upfront about the factors you didn't take into account! But 1. not mentioning &amp; centring significant external factors &amp; 2. drawing hard-&amp;-fast conclusions is...not it . 📣Útlendingahatur/xenofóbía er ekki algjört sama kerfi eins og rasismi!! They intersect quite a bit, especially if you're not white *and* a non-citizen. But I've heard the sentence "white eastern Europeans face more oppression than Black &amp; brown ppl in Iceland" and...lmao no . #USER# I'm appalled by how common this is. I've seen so many white folks absolutely mangle and slaughter the language of abolition &amp; restorative justice to repurpose for their own arguments, while completely missing the essence and spirit of RJ/TJ . General conservatism/status quo maintenance issues that come w/ "elder deference" aside (BIPOC who have mainly lived outside the imperial core...wykyk), older trans folks unfortunately often perpetuate narratives on sex &amp; gender rooted in survival-mandated assimilationism. . @ white people in the replies saying "I would stop eating before giving up my cat/dog"... Shut the fuck up. Seriously. #URL# . #USER# It's fucking horrible. I am so angry.   Fascinatingly enough the author tries to legitimise her points by saying she's taking shots at the bourgeoisie white women, meanwhile the most vocal criticism I've seen for this book has been from Black &amp; brown queer survivors . There is a very specific kind of neolib twitter activist that keeps using the term "bi+" as some sort of umbrella term &amp; conflating nearly all forms of queerness w/ "bisexuality", and they are all the fucking worst lmao .

TW: racist violence, lynching  Holy shit #URL# . #USER# I think the atmosphere around earth sciences &amp; ecology are a bit better bc the departments are usually part of the university &amp; not in the medical centre...but holy shit biomedical research is an utter mess. I know chemistry depts are awful as well . This. It's v frustrating to see pick-me trans ppl cede ground on this for a hollow mimicry of "acceptance" &amp; so-called "cis allies" rebutting transphobia by saying "most trans people don't believe this". Ceding ground on essentialism isn't gonna liberate us. #URL# . Anyways honestly I reaaaallly wanna mute all queer and trans discourse (especially from white folks &amp; USians) unless it's explicitly a peripheral radic analysis within the global context of colonialism &amp; imperialism . #USER# #USER# They never once said everyone needs to post their personal info online &amp; it's absolutely awful (&amp; reeks of anti-Blackness) how their genuine perspective on being a Black queer organiser in this hellscape is being distorted &amp; dismissed . How dare you use your massive platforms to assert "this shouldn't be brought up bc nobody needs to hear this"? . Meanwhile y'all get to chase clout, call yourselves activists as a means to an end to take up space &amp; never give up the fucking mic as self-appointed spokespeople LMAOOO Icelandic society is a running year-long comedy sketch that writes itself . ...who also takes into account any angling etc around/in your internal reproductive organs . !!!!! 👇 This is also the *only* way I can even tolerate having people in my circles who voted for the two cops last election cycle, i.e. if you're opening your purse &amp; providing material reimbursement for the damage caused by your "not-Tr*mp" political compromise #URL# . 📣📣📣  The valuation of USian lives over others when so, so many BIPOC lives are taken by US imperialist violence on the daily is frankly disgusting and never more apparent than this day every year #URL# . 2.

I want so much better for trans folks than to feel like they have to be stuck with people whose sexualities exclude who they really are e.g. trans women w/ gay men &amp; trans men w/ gay women (&amp; no, it does *not* matter whether you "pass" etc). Y'all deserve the world❤️ . Since validity vs violence discourse is on my TL again...  #URL# . Celebrities will not liberate us--they're literally part of a detached wealthy capitalist elite. It's fine to enjoy a nice unshitty thing they did but that's not liberation! (I do want to be mindful of how we come for Black celebs only when saying "fuck all celebs") . Finlay Institute in Cuba also created candidates for the only true 'people's vaccine' for COVID (I've seen the scientific background on Soberana 02 &amp; it's very cool) and they are planning on giving the vaccine to exploited countries that need it iirc. #URL# . Meanwhile the conversation I really hope we can get to ASAP (bc Black, brown &amp; Indigenous precolonial science knew this already!!) is that 'biological sex' isn't entirely biological either &amp; is not only influenced in real-time by social conditions, but also constructed over time! . even though they have as much right to belong in these spaces &amp; they shouldn't have to hide their bodies to belong there, either. . #USER# wishing you the happiest, safest &amp; most healing of holidays!

Physio said I did rly well but I am tiiiired after taking 10-12 steps total along a rail bar 😭 Worried about the prospect of it all declining again bc my numbness had been up-and-down throughout the past two weeks. It's hard to trust progress. . Especially when considering hypermarginalised folks who are most likely to consider leaving, what you're saying is them staying &amp; continuing to produce &amp; ~~contribute their talent~~ AND perform free fucking labour to "change" institutions is more important than their wellbeing . Does some have a Coursera plus account that they'd be okay to share with me? There is a specialisation that I'm REALLY excited for, but I need access to the assignments for it to make sense. . is he submissive and breedable, or are ur toxic traits manifesting in the full moon 😞 . big day for those who look like they were assigned f*ggots at birth!! #URL# . Also ofc it's a white trans person cracking down on this when hypermedicalisation disproportionately hurts poor BIPOC trans folks who can't access medical interventions even if they want them &amp; are routinely invalidated, dehumanised &amp; denied their identity when they can't . Lmao ofc this take will come from light-skin brown folks choosing to remain oblivious to the horrific levels of colourism in their societies and the ways they wield the power of having proximity to whiteness against their dark-skin counterparts both in the west and out #URL# . +aside from yt trans people reinforcing violent regressive colonial notions wrt sex &amp; gender and causing systemic harm, I as a brown trans man have lost count of the ways: 1. White transmascs have been the f-ing worst 2. White transfems have weaponised white femininity against me . Hahaha so the quoted account decided to go through my older tweets talking about refugeephobia &amp; then labelled me a 'hypocrite'.n??nStating the fact that documented refugees &amp; children of immigrants have specific relative privileges doesn't mean "refugeephobia does not exist" lol . P.S. this conversation can't be initiated/dominated by oppressors ((white) westerners n the case of criticising Islam, &amp; Muslim folks in the case of ex-Muslims/persecuted religious minorities speaking up). That defeats the purpose of giving voice to the marginalised. . #USER# ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ just always v v glad you fought back &amp; are alive  tw: DV   when my abusive ex kept shoving &amp; hitting me repeatedly out of our former place, I finally snapped &amp; my arm swung in a punch towards his chin. I ended up pulling back before the hit struck bc it felt off to me . - There is something v insidious about non-Black &amp; non-brown white &amp; light-skin (trans) folks shitting on their appearance, makeup etc. It reeks of racism &amp; colourism + not conforming to white colonial modes of beauty &amp; appearance isn't a failure. . #USER# (also the "but who says it" was a bit of a rhetorical question bc that definition is pretty commonly used &amp; co-opted by white leftists 😅) .

Wtf Keflavík Airport?? Crammed crowds of 100s of arriving passengers, no lines, no distancing, no mechanism to regulate inflow in the middle of the bloody pandemic and the worst peak of delta variant infections in Iceland.

Yup just going to the eye hospital for one (1) visit will cost me €450 🙃🤡 . Even aside from the refugee scenario, just being in Europe provides an alternate paradigm of analysing these power dynamics. A huge chunk of violent transphobic backlash in Europe revolves around the "there are only two genders" BS. Non-binary ppl are systemically abused.... . No this isn't about "arbitrary wealth cutoffs" but holy shit it takes 3 seconds of critical thinking to make the distinction. Please . #USER# I also hate how the misuse of "gaslighting" not only ignores its dynamics in DV/abuse, it also trivialises the impact of systemic gaslighting where the gaslighting enacted by individuals might not be as 'sharp' as in DV, but within a systemic context? That shit horrific . - feeling shaky when the elevator has been stopping near the level where I got profiled   I've had to talk to a host of white Dutch people--ranging from "kind of trying to get it" to "I'm ok compromising the safety of Black &amp; brown folks to prevent thefts". .

I'm learning to navigate that space where I'm not triggered anymore, but it's still hard &amp; heavy to see apologia &amp; justification for abuse &amp; sexual violence.

I'm not gonna share that B*wers article but it's not at all unsurprising that a white trans person is voicing transmedicalist, bioessentialist &amp; cis-appeasing conservative narratives around trans healthcare. They keep enforcing gatekeeping to keep colonial gender lines in place. . There's a very very interesting phenomenon of "passing" (typically white, of course) trans folks demanding the abandonment of certain guidelines on care &amp; non-assumption around gender (e.g. pronouns) just so they can assimilate to cisness &amp; erase the very question of transness . North Americans are so weird &amp; puritanical holy shit . This list is mostly BIPOC except for two (and yes you should exclusively focus on the BIPOC right now):  #URL# .

I want to bring up some of the dangers &amp; pitfalls wrt centring voices based on this measure of "experience":nnSome of the worst silencing I've experienced has been from white trans "elders"/white trans folks who have been out for decades (coughprominentIcelandicyttranscough) #URL# . lmao queer is a reclaimed umbrella term.

Being back in Iceland for the first document renewal is financially *kicking my ass*. Please share &amp; d0nate if you can! #URL# . Y'all also forget to notice how whenever a white trans person (often a white trans woman) tweets some ashy take on, idk, pronouns--"don't ask pronouns when it's ~~obvious~~"--plenty of Black &amp; brown non-binary AND "binary" trans folks express discomfort with this re: . Thread. For a whole year I had been holding my breath over neolib "bi+ activism" on Twitter &amp; the implicit/explicit harms it engages in. It's not just about taking away agency from ppl by shoving them under this convenient "umbrella", but it sure as hell is a red flag. #URL# . #USER# gahhahahaha this gave me a good belly full of laughter. thank you . I'm convinced Icelanders as a collective are a fan of co-opting ideas from Black, brown &amp; Indigenous communities in a half-baked manner &amp; then twisting them to defend the very structures the original ideas set out to destroy (it's quite Hegelian honestly) . educating the masses for free is hard.

"t4t will solve all your romance &amp; dating woes 😌--" I'm a brown refugee, have you met white trans folks . Assignment of white colonial genders &amp; perception thereof wrt Black , brown &amp; Indigenous people isn't just a matter of "being valid" or "erasure"--it's an offshoot of colonial violence against us regardless of whether or not we "pass" according to white trans standards. . Noticing this trend where binary trans folks* are trashing nonbinary folks or throwing them under the bus (see that other cursed 'don't ask pronouns if it's ~~obvious~~' tweet) with arguments that pretty much essentialise medical transition along yt colonial imagination of gender #URL# . ...this deference to ppl who have been "out" for decades ends up centring white voices &amp; by extension, white colonial narratives on sex &amp; gender. nWhite trans folks might feel safe &amp; humbled deferring to someone "who came out in the 70s", but for multiply marginalised trans ppl? . (I've made a point of double-checking that everyone I'm listing here has recently used the term "non-binary" for themselves but identities &amp; affinity for labels are fluid &amp; in flux! If it no longer feels right, please let me know &amp; I'll remove the linked tweet from the thread) . I have no complaints. Morphing into a ragdoll and melting into the couch is an underrated experience . - the c*ntrap*ints phenomenon of shirking accountability by calling oneself an "old school transsexual"....no you're not, you're just very white/aligned with white imagination of gender &amp; very pick-me . #USER# Wild to me that white colonisers keep bringing this red herring up...meanwhile as a non-quota refugee (so started as an asylum seeker) I'd 110% trust non-white Indigenous folks to treat refugees, asylum seekers &amp; undocumented folks so much better if they were stewards of the land . P.S. I should have used "perisex" instead of "dyadic" in my earlier tweets bc that's a much more accurate terminology! My bad . innit the truth!

Y'all...BIPOC stands for--&amp; has always stood for--Black, Indigenous &amp; People of Colour, &amp; is meant to centre Black &amp; Indigenous folks.

Someone translate this to Icelandic, have it recorded &amp; blast this through a megaphone at all of the white queer &amp; trans "activists" in Iceland 👀👀👀 (lookin' atchuuu S'78 and trans ísland folks) #URL# . A lot of the qrts were dunking on the thread with the argument "well who perpetrates this violence then?" No, it's not Black women (gonna leave out brown women bc they do perpetuate gendered violence against Black men). But aside from white men, lemme raise you...white women. . @ y'all who constantly put celebs &amp; elite folks on my TL way too much to make points about systemic oppression 👀 #URL# . Same with Hindi! It doesn't really have third-person pronouns at all and they use identifier terms instead, but it's all gender neutral &amp; the same for singular &amp; plural (Hindi is nonetheless a very gendered language). It's "wo" for both singular &amp; plural 3rd person nominative but . Especially wrt leftists who are citizens of the imperial core, many of us who aren't (particularly refugees, asylum seekers &amp; undocumented people) &amp; are intersectionally marginalised have been betrayed &amp; thrown under the bus repeatedly as acceptable political compromises . Now that I can talk about it--I'm about to be unemployed asf in a month &amp; 10 days. I'm already stressing about €€ while my body is screaming that I need to just...not, for a bit.

DO make it very clear that whichever group you're intending to include, *everyone* in that group is included &amp; welcome.

What in the hell is the point of having all this in the non-discrimination policy &amp; then respond like...this when it does happen? How do you decide whether a host did it "intentionally"? Not only did I have pronouns in signature, I even gendered myself as male in IS in msgs #URL# . And ofc, before I forget to mention, these folks feel *extra* entitled to pull this "you're triggering me" clownery on fat Black trans folks 🙃🤡 . #USER# It's extremely possible than even if let's say your antibody peak levels were a teeny bit lower than someone who got the 2nd one at 8 weeks, that gap will be diminished when there is going to be a renewed wave of antibody production with the 3rd shot . Fellow refugees &amp; asylum seekers? This shit *sucks* &amp; the gaslighting gets internalised by us &amp; we're turned into pawns to keep narratives of the 'good assimilated ppl worthy of living' in place. But we must dig these claws out; we must do better--esp by our undocumented comrades #URL# . #USER# Oh yeah definitely (and this becomes kind of apparent w/ how trans men, for example, are de facto assumed to be subs). The tweet I saw was more geared towards any minor talking about or expressing sexuality--especially non-normative desires--in any way whatsoever . #USER# But also a lot of times when yt folks/citizens of the imperial core talk about this, they end up flattening "aspects of the same beast" to mean "if we fight this diluted localised vision of capitalism we have, it'll solve all offshoots of capitalism for the rest of the world" . We can &amp; should talk about the violent historical displacement of Indigenous folks, including Black people, across the world without idk throwing refugees, asylum seekers &amp; undocumented people under the bus &amp; completely flattening the distinct structural violence we face . Yes, that work is *always* simultaneous--we must work on ourselves to do better while doing work to dismantle violent structures. But with the state that y'all are in with your performative "leftism, y'all literally have a 10 kg timber hanging from y'all's ani waiting to drop 💀 . #USER# WoT annoyed the shit out of me &amp; it's definitely part of my general irritation w/ the genre, but the one that got to me today is the W*tcher (which is also a *horribly* ableist show/book series). "She's a girl, it will kill her bc she's a girl!".....ok gurl . #USER# What utter bullshit. White people love to find it appropriate to put the weight of things they find "triggering" on other Black, brown &amp; Indigenous folks without ever sitting down to reflect on how their reaction is a whole function of white supremacist entitlement 🥱 . #USER# It's always "catboy" in usernames with the worst bloody takes .

State government pub health made plenty of mistakes responding to a one in a century pandemic. #HASHTAG# . #USER# I'd also be advising parents to vote #HASHTAG# because the #HASHTAG# won't end well for anyone #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# Remember Hokey telling the auto manufacturers to leave Australia. Remember all those news stories about white hot anger of all the manufacturing jobs lost and the damage to the economy? Neither do I. #USER# really doesn't have any credibility left. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Ludicrous! Why does #USER# let Fraudenburg comment outside of his portfolio? Not relevant and not credible  #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# "We have allowed our campaign finance laws to become a strategic threat to our country." #HASHTAG# . #USER# This is the inherent conflict between "entertainment " and public interest journalism. . #USER# #USER# That's more employment than the coal industry.  I wonder if they have similar subsidies? . #USER# #USER# #USER# I'm fairly confident media can dictate policy agenda and bring down any government so I would say Murdoch shelters LNP rather than the other way round.  I'm not conf LAB could or would want to regulate and would be left exposed to another franking cred/mining tax campaign. . #USER# Look over there!!! It's an African Gang/Death Tax/Yellow Peril.  Seriously Matt.  Drop the cos play and come up with something credible. . #USER# So. Is Dr Nick still getting paid? Richard Colbeck still getting paid? Why? . #USER# 1029 cases, hospital code yellow and the media is talking about outdoor recreation. Where is the public interest best served? . #USER# Harvey Norman needs the Corporate Welfare apparently #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# Unlike parliament house where bullies and abuse are dealt with. . #USER# #USER# Therein lies the value of all this constant outrageous RWNJ media circus. Sensible progressive policies look extreme against the likes of Coorey, Creighton and Credlin. Morrison looks like a moderate. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Your the reporter. Do some research and give us the context. What are the revised odds and how does that compare to the Tasmanian road toll? #HASHTAG# . #USER# Seriously #USER# What is it with you and the cafe owners? Leigh Sales and the anti lockdown activism now this #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# In the name of balance Speersy and Sales should be relegated to "ABC After Dark " 11pm time slot. . #USER# Any comments from the responsible minister. Richard Colbeck,  Greg Hunt,  Scott Morrison? Easily preventable catastrophe but Scotty was "going to the footy " instead of leading a national pandemic response.  No consequences for failed ministers or failed gov policies. #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# Fascinating must read article but Geezuz! For example, in 2001, when Bob Carr, a Labor Premier, was about to appoint Michael Costa police minister, he sent Costa to Jones’s home to discuss law-and-order policy . #USER# #USER# Oh Jeff. True to LNP form. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Where is the political leadership nationally and in NSW? What is wrong with these people? #HASHTAG# . #USER# I think Louise Stanley has got some questions to answer. . #USER# #USER# I'm certainly sick of media personalities with platforms engaging in divisive politics. Media should be working in the public interest. If a manufacturer caused a public health emergency they would be shut down. Time to shut down #USER# . #USER# We could ask Angus to sign up for some offshore strategic nuclear fission reserves. Go team Tim! . #USER# Wow. 43.5% are seeing something I'm not . #USER# All that time studies bible, going to church,  praying and talking in tongues and he still doesn't know right from wrong.  #HASHTAG# . #USER# Even better.  Come home and call an election . #USER# I'm surprised you're not suggesting kids need more strong coal in their lives. You're starting to let the side down Matt. . #USER# #USER# My thoughts exactly.

That would be why the Vic curve is after the NSW curve. I'm not even an epidemiologist,  or a journalist. Just common sense. . #USER# Poor Tom. Only a 3AW shock jock. Must be humbling to have a dad like John . #USER# I thought Tudgy Wudgy was one of the Hillsong faithful? What will happen to all the car parks promised for Knox? . #USER# Agreed.  Equally let's condem media orgs undermining public health directives and providing cover for political negligence.  How about each working journalist donate 30% of the wage to essential workers? What do you think #USER# ? . #USER# Not recycled? Just the standard issue LNP brown paper bag. #HASHTAG# . #USER# How are we going with our record debt and deficit Mr Tresurer. #HASHTAG# . #USER# New generation mask and PPE required. . #USER# Headline - "In hindsight, LNP foresight not so good. Thank God for our franking credits " . #USER# Another forgettable contribution from Murdoch's minions. I can't believe Murdoch can get away with not paying tax.  #HASHTAG# . #USER# Surely you can't be suggesting nines chairman Peter Costello isn't prioritising public interest journalism? . #USER# Sounds like a great idea to extend the life of coal extraction. #HASHTAG# at his best . #USER# #USER# But will the government do anything about online disinformation from known sources like Craig Kelly? How did we get to the position where anonymity is the cause of Australia's problems? Thanks for the quality journalism . #USER# Hey! Love your work.  I take back all those bad things I said about MSM but we still need a #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# I can't tell if this is the Age parody account or not. Comments attributed to Downer are comical because he is irrelevant. KR and MT clearly have something to offer in terms of public interest commentary. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Also keeps the swing voters disinterested in "politics". . #USER# So how will #USER# counter media bias to win the election? Labor ads so far are pretty ordinary. And when in gov what will Labor do to improve media regulation and diversity? . #USER# #USER# #USER# So how does #USER# stand platforming a "corruption apologist" and how is the normalisation of corruption in the public interest? I'd like #USER# to take this question on notice. . #USER# #USER# But it's OK to politicise the armed forces if you don't have proactive policies and have gutted the public service... . #USER# #USER# shame. I'm embarrassed. What happened to our ABC? . #USER# On the plus side. The media management strategy seems to be working. . #USER# #USER# Wow! Foresight! Even more impressive in hindsight. . #USER# I get a bit defensive when people criticise Twitter as though MSM is all squeaky clean.  I would have thought journalists and "personalities " providing platforms for misinformation and hate speech were the bigger problem and worth a regulatory response. . #USER# I'd always understood that's what it meant and LNP apologists were OK with that. . #USER# The problem is not the minority of dissenters. The problem is the media amplifying a minority view  into a sustained campaign to undermine public health directives. . #USER# I'm expecting a pilots cosplay outfit for this tweet.  Do better . #USER# Agreed.  How do we explain all journalists reporting that schools are safe and no one asking the obvious questions? . #USER# Think of the money they'll save on ... public health services . #USER# How does Costello's #USER# provide a conflict of interest disclaimer on this headline? Surely someone found guilty of falsifying an election by branch stacking is not a credible news source. Oh. Wait a minute #HASHTAG# . #USER# It beggars belief that #USER# can still draw a wage given his lack of credibility after his "Gladys saves Australia" puff piece. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Wel it's an improvement from his last trip to Engadine Macas . #USER# I would have thought, in this case, governments were OBLIGED to get involved in people's lives to protect public safety. If we compare Victoria's governance of the pandemic vs Federal governance of climate change which approach protects public safety? . #USER# Just beggers belief that a government with such a strong background of law and order and a supportive police chief can't police basic public health directives. We can arrest youtubers but not people putting lives a risk. #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# Beggars belief #USER# "journalist" can run aa story about Gladys and not mention the overwhelming evidence of corruption. WTF is wrong with the #USER# and what happened to the public interest here? . #USER# #USER# Any of the diggers ask about Federal aged care services? Anyone remember the fallen from 2020 aged care catastrophe? #USER# seemingly working as a paid propagandist. #HASHTAG# . #USER# Lots of people opposed seat belts when they were introduced. Mandates required some political risk for public safety. In hindsight reduced fatality rate AND the fact that people are not rational proves why mandates are necessary. . #USER# Thank you NSW LNP. Thank you VIC LNP. Thank you MSM. Thank you Corporate Welfare Lobby. But most of all. Thank you to Morrison and Fraudenburg for you ruthless media management strategy.  #HASHTAG# . #USER# Good news story at last. #USER# finally supporting Melbourne . #USER# This is how LNP can win the next election.  They have the infrastructure in place to manipulate media narrative and therefore public discourse.  Only way LNP will be beaten is with new media and concerted attacks on usual MSM suspects . #USER# Sadly I share your fears. The Corporate Welfare Lobby have got an army of propagandists posing as ministers,  every media outlet eating out of their hands and the IPA. What do the Public Interest Lobby have? Albo and Twitter... #HASHTAG# . #USER# Looking forward to the national broadcaster running commentary supporting public health directives and not highlighting the the contrarians . #USER# #USER# #USER# The regulator and the government needs to be held to account. Media diversity and journalism standards are life and death issues. #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# Factual informative info required to counter the BS alarmists from Murdoch. Great to see infrastructure projects being delivered rather than just promised and taxpayer money syphoned off for marginal seats. . #USER# #USER# I think most Australians can relate to Macron's frustration and the offence caused by the #HASHTAG# All Australians know how Macron feels . #USER# The reality is that most Australians understand the value of vaccines and are waiting patiently for their turn.   Why the constant BS about hesitancy? . #USER# Breaking - NSW hoteliers and clubs have the new premier over a barrel. . #USER# #USER# Should media personalities with platforms forment conflict? . #USER# #USER# Hard to avoid the accusation the point of this article from the Costello daily was to hijack the headlines.  Embarrassing how many ABC journalists fell for it. . #USER# I can't believe Murdoch pays #USER# to quite this garbage.   #USER# should hire some journalists . #USER# #USER# #USER# Gold Standard.  Can't wait  to see the Sky News headlines. . #USER# So will the swing voting margins turn on the nightly news tonight and see "heroic struggles of the working man fighting against tyranny of government" or will they see Victorian democratic processes under attack by a violent mob? #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# I'm certainly against media personalities fabricating dissent to undermine a popularly elected government doing a great job managing a public health emergency. . #USER# ABC working in the public interest again.  I'm so relieved. . #USER# Credit where Credit is due. Good one Speersy . #USER# #USER# #USER# I think many people are ashamed #USER# and other media personalities with large platforms legitimise ignoring mainstream science. We desperately need media diversity. #HASHTAG# . #USER# The Liberal Party have a clear cut "open the economy " corporate welfare platform.  But what do the National Party stand for? . #USER# #USER# I would suggest #HASHTAG# and his brand of media management are more a threat to ordinary Australians through his attacks on social services, Medicare, universities, free press, wage stagnation, export markets, housing affordability....rather than national security. . #USER# Masterful framing of election narrative. Freedom vs dictatorship. If there is one thing the #HASHTAG# is good at its winning elections. We need #HASHTAG# to start highlighting opportunities and victories of good governance. . #USER# #USER# He's waiting for #USER# to come back and ask him about how tough his favourite cafe owner has been doing it over the pandemic. . #USER# #USER# I believe all the hivis costumes were bought out for the CFMEU cosplay parade a couple of weeks ago . #USER# Is Macron safe from prosecution with his recent truth bomb? #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# Looks like he's done it tough over lockdown. . #USER# Hey but let's deny, deflect and delay. Isn't Twitter a real problem... . #USER# For all the stupidity in this tweet I'm glad people haven't forgotten the 800 deaths in aged care. Federal minister responsible for quarantine and aged care still have their jobs despite gross negligence.     #HASHTAG# . #USER# FFS. It's a science and technology org you moron. It's supposed to be researching new tech. No one argued it shouldn't develop WiFi because it would put print media out of business.  #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# #USER# One Victorian has described Libs adoption #HASHTAG# disinformation tactics as "insane" and suggests they stop sponging off taxpayer incomes. . #USER# Remember that time when Jesus covered up a rape to win an election... . #USER# Think of all the non belivers he infected. Maybe Creighton was right and we should sacrifice some people for the greater good. For good measure they should be quarantined in their churches to avoid burdening hospitals and the economy. Win win. #HASHTAG# . #USER# #USER# What was their response when they were told their taxes would be used to prop up failing businesses who donate to #HASHTAG# like  coal, gas, oh and Murdoch. . #USER# I would like a constructive way to challenge the dominant outragy media cycle.

Not  worth the tweet. . #USER# #USER# And when will #USER# and #USER# issue an apology for undermining public health directives? . #USER# On the plus side Vic tracing has always been very proactive and the test numbers are still high. Let's hope people adhere to lockdown guidelines till we get 95% of the total population vaccinated. . #USER# Not really news worthy is it. Maybe stop and think if it's relevant to the public interest before posting. . #USER# #USER# Quality writing, especially the bit about a government full of Ayn Rand fetishists . #USER# I thought Scott had already destabilised our economy and healthcare after not implementing quarantine,  not preparing aged care and not ordering vaccines. Not sure how anyone could do worse. #HASHTAG# . #USER# I believe Big Wino has got a lot to answer for. Making money off poor students with the cask conspiracy is unconscionable. . #USER# Imagine a state premier announcing that we should all learn to live with the fires and keep everything open because fire restrictions, back burning, fire resistant building standards aren't good for the economy. . #USER# The problem is when a vanishingly small proportion gets overrepresented in the media. That's not democracy.  That's the majority being exploited for clicks and ratings. . #USER# #USER# #USER# #USER# What!!! Why does "ALP need to commit"!!!  Morrison gov is corrupt.

This Bills ass kicking is payback for what white folks did on January 6th .

Ice Cube tried to undermine an election and Kanye ran for President to siphon black votes lest we forget lol #URL# .

I've taken the presence of SO many women for granted . During the game even  Folks apologizing for his horrible play and telling how bright the future looks  But can't wait to slander Hurts because he's black   It's shameful to see #URL# . Crazy thing about this is there's very little variance to choose from  Harlem, south Detroit, Gary, south/west Chicago, South Central Los Angeles/Compton  Also being herded into specific areas and forming ghettos was done on purpose #URL# .

Any comment #USER# lol  I know how much you like to defend obvious racism with the Texans organization #URL# . I've found if you come at like the first 10 hard enough it tends to be effective  It's when you try to "tweet through it" that the attempted bullying begins  Just gotta roast the brave ones and let the internet strangers know ain't nothing sweet over here but the Swisher #URL# . Per usual this is more about socio economics and class than it is PURELY racennI'm sure less affluent white females are having out of wedlock babies too just not at the same level per capitannBut it's definitely a bigger issue in our community #URL# . I forgot how delusional Eagles fans were to be honest  I try to avoid talking sports with professional spectators but definitely don't engage an Eagles fan because they're all special in a bad way . Exact same way they bring up Finals records when discussing Bron's individual greatness #URL# . No  Even if you're staunchly atheist and don't believe anything you're still a tool of the enemy  Spiritual death only comes after judgement even then it's torment  We're spiritual beings having a human experience #URL# .

If anything the focus should be on #USER# and the lack of urban area/inner city financial commitment to target potential black phenoms and relive the financial burden  But our Olympic committee also STRONGLY "adheres" to pure amateurism in the Olympics  Despite the NBA/NHL/MLS . Promise if you focus on self and honestly and introspectively analyze your personality you'll realize white women or Asian women or Latina women have NOTHING to do with why men don't want YOUnnIt's not a conspiracy you're just a lame and not good enough . How did you manage to undermine your own creditability as a source in the same hour?? #URL# . Black folks are SO allergic to work and having a work ethic  Boy is literally in poverty but is "playing" the stock market looking for the get rich quick scheme  This is the effect that the tech/crypto scammers have on folks   Tighten up #URL# .

Last time I cried was the Sunday Kobe died  I ugly cried and sobbed and yelled at God and then I was done  Felt good, I kinda get why females do it all the time . 📠nnIt's like the twitter tail is wagging the Hollywood dognnToo busy trying to appease social justice warriors and keyboard activists nnThat budget is insane too lol #URL# . hahahahahaha we don't know how to take nudes anyway  Best you'll get is a POV of our penis in our hands lol  You ladies go all out and even somehow have a photographer handy lol #URL# . Like he said The Whopper was real beef and so big you had to hold it with two hands  Whoppers are lowkey nasty now lol . Brady is also arguably the GREATEST to ever do it  Which by definition makes him a statistical outlier and an anomaly NOT the rule  The game has changed even since Brady/Manning and the '04 QB class  Lack of mobility isn't an asset EVER   That's how the Giants beat the Patriots #URL# . By "best era" you mean least overtly racially oppressive then??  Not an objective analysis of eras or quality of life outside of segregation and the effect of chattel slavery  That's not saying "best era" tho  And as black people we did better from the 1940's-1960's than now FYI #URL# . Overall the quality and valuation of women has plummeting  It's like the romantic Great Depression outchea  PLENTY of pussy and meaningless/empty sex to be had but rare is the actual upwardly mobile dynamic woman even exist much less make herself known in this Ho Is Life era #URL# .

Nobody can ever convince me that wasn't staged and she was fully aware  Even the way she reacted was on rhythm not like how a normal person would react to being exposed in front of millions  JT definitely shrunk away from his part in it but she wasn't the victim at all #URL# . One of the first mob owned fighters #URL# . That's a logical deduction based on her attractiveness and the attention she gets  That's not an "I feel" statement  So nah I reject that premise  Males don't base decisions off of emotion  We're logic based #URL# . Body ody ody ody ody twitter gets their panties in a bunch anytime the topic of the holes in her story comes up #URL# . We NEED a black male journalist version of "Schaap Talk" or "Real Sports"  Not that I don't value the voice of the former black player(except on Fox) but not at the expense of the voice of the objective black writer in the room #URL# . I remember when the twitter mother's literally made beards a thing  Similar to eating ass  So many lame bitches started tweeting about desire for beards and niggas started pretending it was a personality trait for them . Pac said this wasn't true  She acted chummy during production then changed her number immediately after and switched up  So she's lying on the dead #URL# . When you follow Fake Woketeps you'd think 2021 was this bleak Biden dystopia  When in reality if you get your ass up off your shoulders it's harvest time outchea  But "student loan debt forgiveness" tho.... #URL# .

Sounds like he's a budding British comedian #URL# . They don't "think" that  It's just the Fake Woketep anti Biden populist trope  How are the SAME folks that swear off college because it's a scam and push tech scams ALSO in financial ruins over student loan debt  Maff is funny  Most of them didn't even vote, they're just agents #URL# .

Energy is always crazy Friday night in Vegas . I have the "report issue" tab already ready in case the driver is on that fuck shit  Full refund and credit me please #URL# . This is beyond debate  Lowkey next to Asian culture they have the strongest family units in the game  And pandering on social media isn't a barometer of such  Those Hispanic dudes are out building houses they're not simping for pussy on twitter like incels #URL# . Attention is like heroin for females and social media is their fix  I can't conceive of all the dopamine the female brain secretes when a pic goes viral  But I share this sentiment but centered around unintelligent thoughts  I can't believe stupid people are so brazen on here #URL# . Black folks struggle and grind for success JUST so they can flex and throw it into another black person's face still in the strugglennThey never have that energy or smoke for the system that creates the need for struggle tho . BETTER question lol   When did Trump run HIS companies like a "good CEO" string of bankruptcies along with being sued by contractors for lack of payment  The good businessman shit is Republican trope #URL# . Been such  But funny thing is Lauryn Hill warned us in Doo Wap(That Thang)  Industry literally hasn't given us a single mainstream female emcee that doesn't rely on overt sexuality/hypersexuality to sell  Not a single one, this is on purpose #URL# . If not wifing up a ran though whore makes me "vanilla" then so be it internet stranger  Good luck out there! #URL# . Good to know someone else disagrees with the blatant tokenism going on in Hollywood and the "Girl power" movement is bullshit and gender doesn't matter  Refreshingly nice to hear from a female #URL# . Integration is vitally important in a capitalist society because you have the freedom to shop for the best/cheapest price  Instead of being price gouged because of lack of competition and forced commerce  Hoteps/Fake Woketeps don't realize this economic reality . Wow  I miss the brotherhood of a football locker room man #URL# . Wedding vows are a trip when you think about them  It's gotta be somewhat emotional to look a woman in her eyes in front of her family and everyone she loves and PROMISE to always and forever have her back and be her natural support . I wonder this each time she tweets or DMs me  Like I meditate on this thought #URL# . Black men from a certain socio-economic demographic suffer from PTSD   Like for real for real are in need of mental health relief . Yeah that's crazy he's lowkey a bust kinda #URL# . Because even if that's true Brugge still bought him  So you can logically deduce they discussed playing time and opportunities  Also they never played Horvath so I don't give them the benefit of the doubt  Plus Owen is still a teenager..... #URL# . I think being like 45-35 is the perfect age and era to have been born into  A little earlier and we're stuck playing with Slinky and Pong on a Coleco while listening to 45's  A little later and our entire sense of identity and self worth is shaped by strangers and social media . If you voted for Donald Trump to be President of these United States you're NOT qualified to speak on the qualifications of others #URL# . I have NOTHING in common with a hood rat ghetto ass bitch other than the fact we both happen to be black  hard pass  my lady has to be upwardly mobile just like I am #URL# . #USER# Thank you!!! lol gotta beat the drug test tomorrow but I'm gucci .

You got heart for a skinny chick I'll give you that  Weight classes exist for a reason lol that wasn't a fair one that got handed out   But you didn't back down #URL# . Also what's funny is the victim tried to apologize for the perpetrators actions based on her gender and sexual orientation  Had to school her on how NEITHER are relevant  What she did is no different than if a male colleague casually groped you then intimidated you for rejection . NahnnThere's fundamental core differencesnnWhich is why TWO Senators from pretty much red states can prevent progress in the name of "not letting black/brown folks advance"nnThe "both sides are the same" is Fake Woketep twitter drivel #URL# . He obviously misjudged your character for a well adjusted nurturing type female  Hope God speaks to his heart before we end up being subjected to screenshots as well #URL# . Lemme tell you this lol  I pulled this BAD ass white bitch white and she came over (pops let me have female company) and hung out then per the agreement my dad took her home  But she wanted me to drop her off around the corner tho lmaooooooo  The way my dad looked at me bruh #URL# . "college is a scam" morphed into "you don't need a degree for this" which turned into "get this tech cert for easy money" which is now "I play in the crypto/stock market"  If black folks exerted the same energy into education as they do trying to get rich quick we'd be winning . Miami is like a real life crucible for female friendships  Lowkey a rite of passage #URL# . Who cares about cap space when it's a toxic dumpster fire of an organization??  Fish stinks from the head and the Jags are a train wreck  That's not an ideal landing spot for a young coach trying to establish himself as a HC #URL# . I'm not "mad"  And why does my opinion matter to you so much internet stranger  Feel free to be impressed by the nigga that places seeds in the ground and watches them grow into shit  Free country, just dick ride OUT of my mentions please #URL# #URL# . Same way poor white people think Mexicans are taking their jobs lol somehow Hoteps/Fake Woketeps perpetuated the "white women are taking our men" fallacious trope  So now there are accounts DEDICATED to hating on white women because they're the blame for them being forever single #URL# . Oh.....  So you're just a pandering lame nigga for kicks then huh  Log off and hunch on your wife loser #URL# . I'm highly motivated lol I'm outside the Top 25 and I'm running a championship caliber program over here lol #URL# . Fun Fact: TikTok is owned and ran by the Chinese government as a way to data mine and commit espionage on Americans  For what reason in the WORLD would you share this with anyone  Much less an enemy foreign government #URL# . Her tweets definitely hit different once you've been inside her . Same height and body frame lowkey  And then the dominance  But it wasn't ever really a like for like comparison of their respective games per se  Just his level compared to his peers and the buzz coming out of HS was similar to Bron #URL# . Not in a sexual abuse case lol  This isn't rocket science or anything  Same way ex cops wouldn't be optimal in a police brutality case #URL# . *black man head nod*  And nah l thank YOU  You're the hella fine one here deserving of gratitude #URL# . That's subjective analysis and personal bias  And obviously if there are black men expressing a preference outside their race they don't share the same priorities  If you're okay with one type of performative based tweeting then you have to be okay with the other #URL# . Ohhhhhhhhh okay lol yeah not much could be done unless she's a scandalous bitch or it was truly love at first sight  Was she a bad bitch?? #URL# . I mean it's Jersey and population density to land mass is already an issue  I can't imagine they strictly enforce zoning laws the same way Midwestern and Western states with more area do  But this is just an educated guess and it's not like you're wrong either #URL# . I tell people all the time black women aren't a monolith and to not talk about them as such  But nobody cares when it's in the form of pandering but everyone reacts when it's under the realm of dating preferences or cultural observations #URL# . New blacks have NO issue allowing their kids to grow up believing there's 37 genders but also refuse to let their kids believe in Santa Claus  Maff is funny  Takes way less imagination to believe in a fat man going down chimneys worldwide in a single night than to deny biology . Guess we need Brooks to transfer to the MLS and run around the pitch not doing much with the ball for Berhalter to properly rate him #URL# . This is 📠  The difference between how women receive and treat their men is always culturally/socio-economically based  It's not a race issue  Women are women and more importantly black women aren't monoliths  If she was raised to see men as objects to love not tools of survival #URL# . Here's the issue tho.....  With VERY few exceptions (pre med/pre law/journalism) your major really matters not in corporate  They just want to know you possess the discipline to start and finish  Hella successful people work in a field outside their chosen emphasis/major #URL# . Yeah she's a lame ass basic bitch  lol you can tell this because she doesn't even know the difference between "worst" and "worse" lol  Get this bitch the fuck outta here #URL# . I mean he's a Helton guy   But I hope he finds a solid home lol like Mizzou #URL# . If we all sat in the same room and tweeted I guarantee 99% less sass and aggression would be on the TL  If the constant threat of getting the shit smacked or beat out of you was there you'd see how these niggas really move and vibrate . Of course you're rightnnBut "colorism" is how insecure and ineffectual black folks virtue signal and get to pretend how "black" they arennSo light skins have to catch strays so incels can get RTs and attaboys from femcels on this appnnWho listens to radio/podcast and thinks color #URL# . Only thing missing is her holding a big slice of pizza folded over and a Metro card #URL#

How did a nation become so polarized? What happened to the 4th estate and holding governments to account? . #USER# In looking through websites on the 1918 pandemic, it seems there were two very vocal camps then, too. The issues were masking and movement restrictions only, but perhaps this is just humanity(?). . #USER# Thanks for sharing. "Things are more like they are now, than they ever have been before." :) . I just accomplished a major ✅ at work. Thought I was going to miss my deadline for the first time in 11 years. Now I want to hear that MLB has a deal!!! . #USER# #USER# If you want a different team in charge, why not write an op-ed talking about how CPC needs a bigger tent with plans that speak to the vast majority of voters (center L/R). Easy to criticize when your party can't get elected.
