		<document><![CDATA[#USER# If it's biological, then why are women choosing to have less kids while increasingly going to colleges and having jobs? Women only stayed home when they were forced or denied opportunities. Gender roles were created by society, not nature.]]></document>
		<document><![CDATA[#USER# 150 thousand black people were arrested for violent crime and gun crime last year. There are 41 million black people in America. That means less than 1% committed those crimes. The 99% shouldn't be blamed for the actions of the 1%.]]></document>
